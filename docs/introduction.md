# Introduction

Authentication and authorization are essential parts of almost all web
applications. But the underlying logic is different in each application. There
are many great libraries out there, but most have unnecessary abstraction or are
only compatible with specific patterns and libraries.

React Guardian is a lightweight [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) library that
makes it easy to integrate authentication and authorization in React
applications. It provided simple components and utilities to implement user
access control and protect routes and components.
